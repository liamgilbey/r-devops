## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the electronic home for _DevOps for R_. Over the last several years, R has made great strides in making the outputs of data science available to non-technical users. 
Packages such as [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) and [plumber](https://github.com/rstudio/plumber) have done wonders to enable R users to expose their 
amazing work in web applications and web APIs. However, many R users have come from a background of needing to use R with very little formal programming education. While  
the aforementioned packages have gone a long way to empowering users to develop data science applications, there is a knowledge gap in taking this work into a production 
environment.

This book intends to bridge this gap. While it is designed for R users, it features very little R at all. Instead, you'll learn how to use a set of open-source tools 
to interact with your R projects to turn them into production-ready applications. I will preface the book by saying that the set of tools I have chosen to demonstrate 
are not the definitive set of tools to do the job. Like any technical problem, there any many ways to achieve what is described in this book. What is discussed here 
is focused on the use of open-source tools that can be used an deployed by anyone, in any environment.

Like countless other R books created through [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), this book is open source. All of it's content is reproducible and accessible 
by anyone who is interested.
